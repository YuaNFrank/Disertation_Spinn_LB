Neural Network based artificial intelligence has gain popularity in the past years. The bio-inspired idea also led to an increasing research interests for new hardware. Consequently, the Spiking Neural Network Architecture (SpiNNaker) was invented by the European leading research groups. It has a neuromorphic architecture with a biology-inspired hardware design with over a million cores, which not only enable the large scale neural simulation but also provide new opportunities for High-Performance computing, such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). In this project, we take the hardware specificity as an opportunity by porting a CFD algorithm, the lattice Boltzmann method, to the SpiNNaker platform to investigate the scaling ability and compare it with a standard serial implementation on normal CPU. To do this, we: (a) implement a basic lattice Boltzmann method on SpiNNaker platform with over 10,000 cores; (b) demonstrated that the lattice Boltzmann method on the SpiNNaker platform has good performance of speed and advantage in week-scaling.
